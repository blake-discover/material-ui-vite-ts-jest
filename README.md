# Material UI - Vite.js in TypeScript example with Jest

Cloned from [Mui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-vite-ts)

## Intention

This repo was created to demonstrate the default background-color for a Mui Button element is set to it's dark variation in a jsdom enviro.
We believe this might be due to a erroneous hover state being applied to it.
